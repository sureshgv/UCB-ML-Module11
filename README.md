## What drives the price of a car?

Notebook: https://github.com/sureshgv/UCB-ML-Module11/blob/main/prompt_II.ipynb

## Summary
This project analyzed a dataset of 426K cars to determine the factors influencing car prices. Our findings suggest that used car dealers should prioritize the age and mileage of the cars they deal with. Additionally, factors such as the average price of the brand, number of cylinders, and fuel type also have a significant impact on used car pricing. Incorporating these factors into decision-making processes can help dealers make informed choices when acquiring and selling used cars.

In conclusion, our analysis offers valuable insights into the key factors that determine used car prices. By leveraging this information, used car dealers can optimize their inventory and enhance their sales strategies, ultimately leading to improved business outcomes. 

## Report
### Introduction:
The objective of this project was to develop a predictive model for used car prices to assist a group of used car dealers. Our aim was to identify the key factors that influence used car prices and provide actionable insights to the dealers.

### Methodology:
We initiated the project by exploring and cleaning the dataset, eliminating null values and irrelevant columns. Subsequently, we performed exploratory data analysis to uncover any discernible patterns or relationships in the data.

Next, we constructed several regression models employing diverse algorithms such as linear regression, ridge regression, lasso regression, and decision tree regression. We assessed the performance of each model using metrics such as R^2 scores and feature importance scores.

### Findings:
Our analysis revealed that the year of the car, mileage (odometer reading), average price of the brand, number of cylinders, and fuel type were the most influential factors affecting used car prices. Among the models we developed, the decision tree regression model demonstrated the highest performance with an R^2 score of 0.88, indicating its ability to explain 88% of the price variability in the data.

### Recommendations:
Based on our findings, we recommend that used car dealers pay close attention to the age and mileage of the cars they handle. Additionally, considering the average price of the brand, number of cylinders, and fuel type can significantly impact the pricing of used cars. Dealers should incorporate these factors into their decision-making processes when acquiring and selling used cars.

### Conclusion:
In conclusion, our analysis provides valuable insights into the key determinants of used car prices. By leveraging this information, used car dealers can optimize their inventory and enhance their sales strategies, leading to improved business outcomes.
